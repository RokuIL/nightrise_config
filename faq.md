### Why does the app need notifications permission?
When an alarm goes off, the app shows a notification and allows you to stop or snooze.

### My alarms are not reliable. What can I do?
Likely the device is running some battery optimization software that is preventing the alarm from firing on time. Check out [Don't Kill My App](https://DontKillMyApp.com/) to find out more about optimizations done by different device vendors.

If it doesn't solve the problem, go to Settings\General and switch to use the "System App for Alarms".

### Can I remove the ads?
Yes! Although we try hard to make ads unitrusive while you sleep, you can remove them completely by buying a monthly subscription.
